# AtliQ Grands Hospitality Business Project

## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, a luxury/business hotel chain, is facing challenges in the hospitality industry, including declining market share and revenue due to strategic competition and management issues. To address these challenges, the managing director initiated a "Business and Data Intelligence" project aimed at regaining market share and revenue.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project was to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to monitor key metrics across AtliQ Grands' hotels located in various metro cities. The dashboard provides insights into critical hospitality metrics, helping the management make informed decisions.

### Key Metrics Unveiled

This project revealed several key metrics crucial to success in the hospitality domain:

1. **ADR (Average Daily Revenue):** The average payment for rooms sold in a given time period.
2. **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):** The average number of rooms booked per day during a time period.
3. **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** The average number of rooms available for sale per day during a time period.
4. **DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** The average number of rooms successfully used by customers per day during a time period.
5. **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** A key indicator of hotel performance, calculated as revenue divided by the total available room nights.
6. **Occupancy Percentage:** The percentage of successfully booked rooms out of the total available capacity.
7. **No-Show Rate:** The percentage of customers who fail to show up for their bookings.
8. **Realization Percentage:** The percentage of successfully checked-out bookings and overall bookings made.

## Project Conclusion

This Power BI report analyzes three months' worth of booking data, providing actionable insights to the revenue team while incorporating standard hospitality metrics. The report includes clear recommendations for improving the pricing model and implementing cost-cutting strategies. This work is instrumental in assisting AtliQ Grands in improving revenue and regaining market share.

As a result of the insights gained from this project, the revenue team at AtliQ Grands anticipates regaining 20% of their lost revenue and market share in the next month.
